# 🔐 Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## 📘 Objective
The goal of this task is to understand what makes a password strong, create different types of passwords, evaluate their strength using online tools, and reflect on password security best practices.

## 🔍 Observations
- Short passwords are extremely easy to crack.
- Adding just one symbol or number greatly improves security.
- Passwords with 14+ characters and diverse symbols are exponentially harder to crack.
- Passphrases with symbols and numbers are strong and memorable.

## 🔓 Common Password Attacks

### Brute Force Attack
A method where attackers try all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found. It is time-consuming for strong passwords but very fast for weak ones.

### Dictionary Attack
Attackers use a precompiled list of commonly used passwords, words, and patterns. It’s especially effective against short or common passwords like "123456", "password", or "admin".

## 🔐 Password Security Best Practices
- Use passwords that are at least 12–16 characters long.
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid using personal information (like names or birthdates).
- Don’t reuse the same password on multiple platforms.
- Change passwords regularly or after any breach.
- Always enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

## 🔑 Related Concepts

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Adds an extra step like OTP, fingerprint, or phone prompt after entering a password. It prevents unauthorized access even if the password is compromised.

### Password Managers
Securely store and generate complex passwords. Examples include Bitwarden, 1Password, and KeePass.

### Passphrases
Using 3-4 random, unrelated words along with symbols or digits (e.g. `Sky$Train#Bubble2025`) can make passwords both strong and easy to remember.

## 🚫 Common Mistakes
- Using weak passwords like "123456", "password", or "qwerty".
- Reusing passwords across multiple platforms.
- Using short or simple patterns (like `abc123`).
- Not enabling MFA.

## ✅ Conclusion
This task gave me hands-on insight into the real-world impact of password complexity. Using free tools, I tested various passwords and realized how significantly strength improves with complexity. A few simple changes like length, variety, and unpredictability can turn an easily cracked password into one that’s nearly impossible to break.
